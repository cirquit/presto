%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

@article{Jeon2018,
abstract = {With widespread advances in machine learning, a number of large enterprises are beginning to incorporate machine learning models across a number of products. These models are typically trained on shared, multi-tenant GPU clusters. Similar to existing cluster computing workloads, scheduling frameworks aim to provide features like high efficiency, resource isolation, fair sharing across users, etc. However Deep Neural Network (DNN) based workloads, predominantly trained on GPUs, differ in two significant ways from traditional big data analytics workloads. First, from a cluster utilization perspective, GPUs represent a monolithic resource that cannot be shared at a fine granularity across users. Second , from a workload perspective, deep learning frameworks require gang scheduling reducing the flexibility of scheduling and making the jobs themselves inelastic to failures at runtime. In this paper we present a detailed workload characterization of a two-month long trace from a multi-tenant GPU cluster in a large enterprise. By correlating scheduler logs with logs from individual jobs, we study three distinct issues that affect cluster utilization for DNN training workloads on multi-tenant clusters: (1) the effect of gang scheduling and locality constraints on queuing, (2) the effect of locality on GPU utilization, and (3) failures during training. Based on our experience running a large-scale operation, we provide design guidelines pertaining to next-generation cluster schedulers for DNN training workloads.},

abstract = {Graphics processing units (GPUs) embrace many-core compute devices where massively parallel compute threads are offloaded from CPUs. This heterogeneous nature of GPU computing raises non-trivial data transfer problems especially against latency-critical real-time systems. However even the basic characteristics of data transfers associated with GPU computing are not well studied in the literature. In this paper, we investigate and characterize currently-achievable data transfer methods of cutting-edge GPU technology. We implement these methods using open-source software to compare their performance and latency for real-world systems. Our experimental results show that the hardware-assisted direct memory access (DMA) and the I/O read-and-write access methods are usually the most effective, while on-chip micro controllers inside the GPU are useful in terms of reducing the data transfer latency for concurrent multiple data streams. We also disclose that CPU priorities can protect the performance of GPU data transfers. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The aim is to provide the computer industry with the opportunity to build a hosting architecture, massively scalable which is completely open source, while overcoming the constraints and the use of proprietary technologies. Then, we present the solution OpenStack retained by the comparative study. We discuss in detail its functional and architectural system.

  author = {Ren, Yihui},
  abstractNote = {This work examines the performance of leading-edge systems designed for machine learning computing, including the NVIDIA DGX-2, Amazon Web Services (AWS) P3, IBM Power System Accelerated Compute Server AC922, and a consumer-grade Exxact TensorEX TS4 GPU server. Representative deep learning workloads from the fields of computer vision and natural language processing are the focus of the analysis. Performance analysis is performed along with a number of important dimensions. Performance of the communication interconnects and large and high-throughput deep learning models are considered. Different potential use models for the systems as standalone and in the cloud also are examined. The effect of various optimization of the deep learning models and system configurations is included in the analysis.},

abstract = {TensorFlow is a machine learning system that operates at large scale and in heterogeneous environments. Tensor-Flow uses dataflow graphs to represent computation, shared state, and the operations that mutate that state. It maps the nodes of a dataflow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a machine across multiple computational devices, including multicore CPUs, general-purpose GPUs, and custom-designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This architecture gives flexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous "parameter server" designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with a focus on training and inference on deep neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataflow model and demonstrate the compelling performance that TensorFlow achieves for several real-world applications.},

abstract = {This specification defines a lossless compressed data format that is compatible
with the widely used GZIP utility. The format includes a cyclic redundancy check
value for detecting data corruption. The format presently uses the DEFLATE method
of compression but can be easily extended to use other compression methods. The
format can be implemented readily in a manner not covered by patents.}

abstract = {This specification defines a lossless compressed data format. The data can be produced
or consumed, even for an arbitrarily long sequentially presented input data stream,
using only an a priori bounded amount of intermediate storage. The format presently
uses the DEFLATE compression method but can be easily extended to use other compression
methods. It can be implemented readily in a manner not covered by patents. This
specification also defines the ADLER-32 checksum (an extension and improvement of
the Fletcher checksum), used for detection of data corruption, and provides an algorithm
for computing it.}

abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) has had an immense success in the recent past, leading to state-of-the-art results in various domains, such as image recognition and natural language processing. One of the reasons for this success is the increasing size of DL models and the proliferation of vast amounts of training data being available. To keep on improving the performance of DL, increasing the scalability of DL systems is necessary. In this survey, we perform a broad and thorough investigation on challenges, techniques and tools for scalable DL on distributed infrastructures. This incorporates infrastructures for DL, methods for parallel DL training, multi-tenant resource scheduling, and the management of training and model data. Further, we analyze and compare 11 current open-source DL frameworks and tools and investigate which of the techniques are commonly implemented in practice. Finally, we highlight future research trends in DL systems that deserve further research.},
