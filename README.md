### How to use Presto for your own experiments

There are basically two things needed:
* A definition of your pipeline (take [`imagenet_pipeline.py`](imagenet_pipeline.py) as an example)
* Generate the different strategies based on the pipeline, see [`imagenet_demo.py`](imagenet_demo.py)
* Run the experiments with `.profile_strategy(...)` with all the possible configuration options (see [`presto/strategy.py`](presto/strategy.py) as reference)
* Load the logs, saved as `pd.Dataframes` into a [`StrategyAnalysis`](presto/analysis.py) and analyze the data with, e.g., a `weighted_summary(...)` call
* The scores are presorted, you can decide on which strategy you want to decide, or automatically pick the highest one. The corresponding strategy is a valid `tf.data.Dataset` pipeline, so you can just reuse it in your pipeline.
